# Rust-sqlite

A rust implementation of sqlite following: <https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial>.

This project was a fun way for me to dive into databases and learn the core concepts of SQL engines from scratch.
As such, please consider this project for what it is—a learning exercise—and not a production-ready tool.
